    <h1>My first project: Create your own garden!</h1>
      <img allowtransparency="true" width="750" height="750" src="project1flowers.PNG" alt="A meadow with flowers drawn in" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
	<h2>In this project we utilized our lessons from Unit 1 which covered loops, nested loops, 
	infinite conditions, moving the "turtle icon" and getting input from the user. The game consists of multiple nested loops and repeatedly asks the user for input so that they can 
	customize their garden. The game first asks how many flowers, then the user is able to control where the flowers are, how many petals they have, what color the petals are,
	and what shape the petals are. The game then ends by asking the user if they want to continue gardening or not, determining if the master loop is repeated again or not.The game
	incorporates all elements of Unit 1, as well as demonstrates the user of nested loops. The game is able to be tailored to the user's exact wishes. This is demonstrated in the picture
	above, which shows flowers with different colors and petal shapes.</h2>

	<h1>My second project: Protect your castle!</h1>
      <img allowtransparency="true" width="750" height="750" src="project2flies.PNG" alt="A castle with a fly flying near it" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
	<h2>In this project we utilized our lessons from 1.2 and implemented several things from it, including a score counter, timer, onclick functions and using random variables in more advanced ways. The game consists of a castle in the
	background that the user must protect from various flies that spawn in from random locations. The flies come in from somewhere random and the user has to click on them to "kill" them and protect the house. 
	After the flies are clicked, they dissapear and are generated from a new random location. If the user fails to click on one in time and it reaches the castle, it simply respawns to give the user another chance. Each time
	a fly is clicked the score increments itself to show the user's progress, while the timer counts down from 30 seconds. After the timer runs out, the game shuts down. This is shown in the image with the fly near the castle,
	waiting for the user to click on it.</h2>
