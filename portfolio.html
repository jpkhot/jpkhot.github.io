	<h2>In this project we utilized our lessons from Unit 1 which covered loops, nested loops, 
	infinite conditions, moving the "turtle icon" and getting input from the user. The game consists of multiple nested loops and repeatedly asks the user for input so that they can 
	customize their garden. The game first asks how many flowers, then the user is able to control where the flowers are, how many petals they have, what color the petals are,
	and what shape the petals are. The game then ends by asking the user if they want to continue gardening or not, determining if the master loop is repeated again or not.The game
	incorporates all elements of Unit 1, as well as demonstrates the user of nested loops. The game is able to be tailored to the user's exact wishes. This is demonstrated in the picture
	above, which shows flowers with different colors and petal shapes.</h2>
